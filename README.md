# fractal-generator

A fractal generator that creates the dragon pattern using [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) pattern rewriting approach.

Output is generated using hiccup library and written to an html file.

## Usage

Open the project in the REPL and evaluate the `fractal-generator.core` namespace.

The let statement at the end of this namespace writes the fractal output to a specific HTML file.  Change the values in the let statement to affect the resulting fractal output.

Several html files are included in this project as examples of generated fractal patterns.
